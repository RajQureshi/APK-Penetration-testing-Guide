To check for sensitive information in an application's memory using Fridump, you can use the following steps:

1. Install Frida and its dependencies on your computer.

2. Connect the device to your computer and enable USB debugging.

3. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the fridump folder in the Frida directory.

4. Use the command python fridump.py -U -p <pid> to dump the memory of the app, where <pid> is the process ID of the app.

5. Use a tool such as strings or grep to search the memory dump for sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or keys.
