How to check Taskbar snooping for the sensitive data is not masked when performing app switching step by step

Taskbar snooping refers to the practice of extracting sensitive information from an app's taskbar, even when the app is not actively being used. This information can be accessed by an attacker if the app is not properly secured. Taskbar snooping can occur when sensitive data is not masked when performing app switching.

Steps to check for Taskbar snooping when performing app switching:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for Taskbar snooping.

2. Install the app on a device or emulator.

3. Test the app by switching between different apps and check if sensitive information is visible on the taskbar when the app is not actively being used.

4. Check if the app uses any technique to mask sensitive data when app switching, such as FLAG_SECURE for the window.

5. Check if the app uses any encryption algorithm to encrypt the sensitive data before storing it in the taskbar.

6. Check if the app uses any technique to prevent Taskbar snooping, such as clearing sensitive data from the taskbar when the app goes to the background.
