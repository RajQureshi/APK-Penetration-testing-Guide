How to check insecure Firebase database step by step

Firebase is a backend as a service platform that allows developers to easily store and retrieve data for their mobile apps. However, if not properly configured, a Firebase database can be a security concern as sensitive information may be leaked or accessed by unauthorized parties.

Steps to check for insecure Firebase database:

1. Extract the APK file: You can use tools such as APKTool or jadx to extract the APK file into its source code.

2. Search for Firebase code: Search the extracted source code for Firebase related code. Look for any instances of the Firebase library being used, such as Firebase Realtime Database or Firebase Authentication.

3. Check Firebase configuration: Once you've identified the Firebase code, check its configuration. Look for any sensitive information being passed to the Firebase instance, such as API keys or database URLs. Also, check if the Firebase instance is using secure communication (HTTPS) to transmit data.

4. Check Firebase database security rules: If the application is using Firebase Realtime Database, check its security rules to see if they are configured securely. Look for any open read or write permissions that may allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

5. Test Firebase Authentication: If the application is using Firebase Authentication, test it thoroughly to see if it can be bypassed or if any vulnerabilities exist.


How check for Firebase configuration and any sensitive information being passed to the Firebase instance in an Android APK, you can follow these steps:

1. Extract the APK file using a tool like Apktool or JADX.

2. Look for the google-services.json file in the extracted APK. This file contains the configuration details for the Firebase instance.

3. Analyze the contents of the google-services.json file for any sensitive information, such as API keys or server credentials.

4. Search for references to the Firebase instance in the decompiled code using a code analysis tool like grep or findstr. Look for any sensitive information being passed to the Firebase instance in the code.

5. Use a tool like Wireshark or Burp Suite to capture and analyze network traffic generated by the app. Look for any data being sent to the Firebase instance and analyze it for sensitive information.
