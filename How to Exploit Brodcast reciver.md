How to Exploit broadcast receiver

A broadcast receiver is a component in Android that allows apps to receive and respond to system-wide broadcasts. An attacker can exploit a broadcast receiver by sending a malicious broadcast intent that mimics a legitimate intent and uses it to launch a receiver in an Android app.

Steps to exploit a broadcast receiver using Drozer:

1. Install Drozer on your computer and connect your Android device to it.

2. Run the command drozer console connect to establish a connection to the device.

3. Use the command run app.package.list -f <target_app_name> to find the package name of the target app.

4. Use the command run app.broadcast.info -a <target_app_package_name> to list the broadcast receivers of the target app.

5. Inspect the broadcast receivers of the target app and look for any that have the attribute "exported" set to "true", indicating that they can be launched from other apps.

6. Create a new android project and add the Drozer agent as a dependency.

7. Use the command run app.broadcast.send --action <target_app_package_name>.<target_broadcast_receiver_name> --extra "key1=value1" "key2=value2" to send a broadcast intent to the target app, the extra fields will be the data you want to pass to the broadcast receiver.

8. The target app's broadcast receiver will launch without proper validation, allowing you to take over the control of the receiver.
Once you have control of the broadcast receiver, you can use it to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.



Steps to exploit a broadcast receiver using ADB:

1. Connect the Android device to your computer and enable USB debugging.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the platform-tools folder in the Android SDK directory.

3. Use the command adb shell dumpsys activity receivers to list all the running broadcast receivers on the device.

4. Inspect the list of receivers to find the target app's package name and the broadcast receiver that you want to exploit.

5. Use the command adb shell am broadcast -a <target_app_package_name>.<target_broadcast_receiver_name> --es key1 value1 --es key2 value2 to send a broadcast intent to the target app, the extra fields will be the data you want to pass to the broadcast receiver.

6. The target app's broadcast receiver will launch without proper validation, allowing you to take over the control of the receiver.

7. Once you have control of the broadcast receiver
