how to check copy paste allowed on sensitive fields step by step

Copy-paste functionality can be a security concern as sensitive information may be copied and pasted into unintended fields or shared with malicious actors. It's important to ensure that copy-paste functionality is disabled for sensitive fields to prevent sensitive information from being leaked.

Steps to check for copy-paste functionality on sensitive fields:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for copy-paste functionality on sensitive fields.

2. Use a tool such as Apktool or Jadx to decompile the APK file and view the app's source code.

3. Inspect the source code for any fields that accept sensitive information, such as password fields or credit card fields.

4. Check if the app uses any controls to prevent copy-paste functionality on sensitive fields, such as disabling the long press context menu or implementing a custom context menu.

5. Inspect the codebase for any calls to the following classes:
android.text.method.TextKeyListener
android.text.method.PasswordTransformationMethod

6. Test the app by attempting to copy and paste text in a sensitive field and observe if the text is pasted.

7. Check if the app uses any encryption algorithm to encrypt the sensitive data before sending it to the clipboard.
