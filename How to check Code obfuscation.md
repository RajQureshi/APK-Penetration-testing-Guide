How to Check Code obfuscation.

Code obfuscation is the process of making code difficult to understand or reverse-engineer by modifying the code in a way that does not change its functionality. It is often used to protect the intellectual property of an app or to prevent attackers from understanding how the app works.

Steps to check for missing code obfuscation:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for missing code obfuscation.

2. Use a tool such as Dex2jar, which can convert the APK file into a JAR file, to convert the APK file into a JAR file.

3. Use a Java decompiler, such as JD-GUI, to open the JAR file and view the app's source code.

4. Inspect the source code for any easily readable variable and method names, comments, or other elements that make the code easy to understand.

5. Search for any hardcoded sensitive information like API keys, username, passwords, etc

6. Check if the app uses any hardcoded encryption keys.

7. Look for any clues of clear text in the code.

8. Check if the app has any anti-debugging or anti-tampering mechanisms.


how to check partial code obfuscation step by step

Code obfuscation is the process of making code difficult to understand or reverse-engineer by modifying the code in a way that does not change its functionality. Partial code obfuscation is when only a subset of the code is obfuscated, leaving the rest of the code in a readable form.

Steps to check for partial code obfuscation:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for partial code obfuscation.

2. Use a tool such as Dex2jar, which can convert the APK file into a JAR file, to convert the APK file into a JAR file.

3. Use a Java decompiler, such as JD-GUI, to open the JAR file and view the app's source code.

4. Inspect the source code for any easily readable variable and method names, comments, or other elements that make the code easy to understand.

5. Search for any hardcoded sensitive information like API keys, username, passwords, etc

6. Check if the app uses any hardcoded encryption keys.

7. Look for any clues of clear text in the code.

8. Check if the app has any anti-debugging or anti-tampering mechanisms.

9. Compare the code with the app's functionality and see if there's any inconsistency in the code.
