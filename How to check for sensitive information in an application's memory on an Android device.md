To check for sensitive information in an application's memory on an Android device, you can use the following steps:

1. Connect the device to your computer and enable USB debugging.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the platform-tools folder in the Android SDK directory.

3. Use the command adb shell to access the device's command line.

4. Use the command run-as <your.package.name> to switch to the app's sandbox.

5. Use the command ps -ef | grep <your.package.name> to find the process ID of the app.

6. Use the command cat /proc/<pid>/maps to display the memory map of the app.

7. Use the command cat /proc/<pid>/mem to dump the memory of the app.

8. Use a tool such as strings or grep to search the memory dump for sensitive information such as passwords, tokens, or keys.
