How to exploit Intent filter for intent spoofing step by step using drozer

Intent spoofing is a type of attack in which an attacker creates a malicious intent that mimics a legitimate intent and uses it to launch an activity or broadcast a receiver in an Android app. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the app's intent filter, which is used to define the intents that an activity or receiver can handle.

Steps to exploit Intent filter for intent spoofing using Drozer:

1. Install Drozer on your computer and connect your Android device to it.

2. Run the command drozer console connect to establish a connection to the device.

3. Use the command run app.package.list -f <target_app_name> to find the package name of the target app.

4. Use the command run app.activity.info -a <target_app_package_name> to list the activities of the target app.

5. Inspect the activities of the target app and look for any that have the attribute "exported" set to "true", indicating that they can be launched from other apps.

6. Use the command run app.broadcast.info -a <target_app_package_name> to list the broadcast receivers of the target app.

7. Inspect the broadcast receivers of the target app and look for any that have the attribute "exported" set to "true", indicating that they can be launched from other apps.

8. Create a new android project and add the drozer agent as a dependency.

9. Use the command run app.activity.start --component <target_app_package_name> <target_activity_name> --extra "key1=value1" "key2=value2" to launch the target activity or run app.broadcast.send --action <target_app_package_name>.<target_broadcast_receiver_name> --extra "key1=value1" "key2=value2" to launch the target broadcast receiver from the malicious app.

10. The target app will launch the activity or broadcast receiver without proper validation, allowing you to take over the control of the activity or broadcast receiver.

11. Once you have control of the activity or broadcast receiver, you can use it to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.
