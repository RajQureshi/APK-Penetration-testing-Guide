How to check Insecure android permission for unnecessary permission

Unnecessary permissions refer to permissions that are requested by an app but are not required for the app to function properly. These permissions can potentially allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or perform other malicious actions on the device.

Steps to check for unnecessary Android permissions:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for unnecessary permissions.

2. Use a tool such as Apktool or Jadx to decompile the APK file and view the app's AndroidManifest.xml file.

3. Inspect the AndroidManifest.xml file for any permissions that the app requests, and check if each permission is required for the app to function properly.

4. Check if the app uses any third-party libraries that might request additional permissions.

5. Check if the app uses any custom code that requests additional permissions.

6. Check if the app uses any deprecated or unnecessary APIs that might request additional permissions.

7. Check if the app uses any permissions that are not required by the app's functionality.

8. Check if the app uses any permissions that are not required by the app's functionality but are requested as dangerous permissions.
