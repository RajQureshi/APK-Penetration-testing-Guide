How to check Integrity checks

Integrity checks are used to ensure that data or files have not been tampered with or modified in an unauthorized way. In android apps, integrity checks can be used to verify that the app and its components have not been tampered with or modified.

Steps to check for missing integrity check:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for missing integrity check.

2. Use a tool such as Apktool or Jadx to decompile the APK file and view the app's source code.

Search the codebase for any calls to integrity check functions such as,
Hash or digital signature verification
Checksum calculation and validation
Certificate Pinning
Code signing

3. Check if the app uses any integrity check functions that are specific to the platform like, Android Verified Boot or Android SafetyNet.

4. Check if the app uses any integrity check functions that are specific to the app like, custom signature or custom checksum.

5. Check if the app uses any integrity check functions that are standard like, SSL certificate pinning.

6. Check if the app uses any integrity check functions that are recommended by OWASP.

7. Check if the app uses any anti-debugging or anti-tampering mechanism.
