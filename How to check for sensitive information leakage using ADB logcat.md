To check for sensitive information leakage using ADB logcat, you can use the following command:

1. Copy code

2. adb logcat | grep -i "password\|key\|token\|secret"

3. This command will display all logcat output that contains the keywords "password", "key", "token", or "secret". You can add or remove keywords as needed to search for specific information.
