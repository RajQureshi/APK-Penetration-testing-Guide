How to check Hard coded sensitive information

Hard-coded sensitive information refers to sensitive data, such as passwords, API keys, or other confidential information, that is included in an app's source code in plaintext. This data can be easily accessed by anyone who has access to the app's code, and can be used to gain unauthorized access to the app or its underlying systems.

Steps to check for hard-coded sensitive information:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for hard-coded sensitive information.

2. Use a tool such as Dex2jar, which can convert the APK file into a JAR file, to convert the APK file into a JAR file.

3. Use a Java decompiler, such as JD-GUI, to open the JAR file and view the app's source code.

4. Search for any hardcoded sensitive information like API keys, username, passwords, etc

5. Inspect the source code for any easily readable variable and method names, comments, or other elements that make the code easy to understand.

6. Check if the app uses any hardcoded encryption keys.

7. Look for any clues of clear text in the code.

8. Compare the code with the app's functionality and see if there's any inconsistency in the code.
