How check insecure android permission

Insecure Android permissions refer to permissions that are granted to an app that allow it to access sensitive data or perform sensitive actions, such as sending or receiving data over the network, that can be easily intercepted by an attacker. Clear text traffic refers to data that is sent or received over the network in plaintext, rather than being encrypted.

Steps to check for insecure Android permissions for clear text traffic:

1. Obtain a copy of the APK file for the Android app that you want to check for insecure Android permissions.

2. Use a tool such as Apktool or Jadx to decompile the APK file and view the app's AndroidManifest.xml file.

3. Check the AndroidManifest.xml file for any permissions that allow the app to send or receive data over the network, such as android.permission.INTERNET, android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, etc

4. Check if the app uses any third-party libraries that might handle network communication.

5. Check if the app uses any custom network communication code.

Inspect the codebase for any calls to the following classes:
HttpURLConnection
URLConnection
WebView
HttpClient
OkHttpClient
Retrofit

6. Check if the app uses any certificate pinning or SSL pinning mechanism

7. Check if the app uses any encryption algorithm to encrypt the data before sending it over the network.
