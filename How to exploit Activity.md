how to exploit activity for activity hijacking step by step

Activity hijacking is a type of attack in which an attacker takes over the control of an Android app's activity. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the app's activity launch mechanism, where the app launches an activity without proper validation or input sanitization.

Steps to exploit an activity for activity hijacking:

1. Identify an app that you want to exploit. Look for an app that allows you to launch external activities or activities from other apps.
Use a tool like Drozer or ADB to inspect the app's activities and intents. This will give you an idea of how the app launches activities and what data it passes to them.

2. Create a malicious app or activity that will be used to launch the target app's activity. This app should be able to receive and process the same intents and data as the target app.

3. Use the malicious app or activity to launch the target app's activity. The app should launch the activity without proper validation or input sanitization, allowing you to take over the control of the activity.

4. Once you have control of the activity, you can use it to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.

Steps to exploit an activity for activity hijacking using Drozer:

1. Install Drozer on your computer and connect your Android device to it.

2. Run the command drozer console connect to establish a connection to the device.

3. Use the command run app.package.list -f <target_app_name> to find the package name of the target app.

4. Use the command run app.activity.info -a <target_app_package_name> to list the activities of the target app.

5. Inspect the activities of the target app and look for any that have the attribute "exported" set to "true", indicating that they can be launched from other apps.

6. Create a new android project and add the drozer agent as a dependency.

7. Use the command run app.activity.start --component <target_app_package_name> <target_activity_name> to launch the target activity from the malicious app.

8. The target app will launch the activity without proper validation, allowing you to take over the control of the activity.

Once you have control of the activity, you can use it to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.



how to exploit activity for activity hijacking step by step using adb

Activity hijacking is a type of attack in which an attacker takes over the control of an Android app's activity. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the app's activity launch mechanism.

Steps to exploit an activity for activity hijacking using ADB:

1. Connect the Android device to your computer and enable USB debugging.

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the platform-tools folder in the Android SDK directory.

3. Use the command adb shell dumpsys activity activities to list all the running activities on the device.

4. Inspect the list of activities to find the target app's package name and the activity that you want to exploit.

5. Use the command adb shell am start -n <target_app_package_name>/<target_activity_name> to launch the target activity from the command line.

6. The target app will launch the activity without proper validation, allowing you to take over the control of the activity.

7. Once you have control of the activity, you can use it to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.


It's also worth mentioning that, this method can be used to launch activities in other apps, but it doesn't guarantee that it will be able to take over the control of the activity, as the app may have implemented proper validation and input sanitization mechanisms.

how to exploit activity for Danial of service step by step using drozer

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack on an Android app's activity is a type of attack in which an attacker floods an app with a large number of requests, causing the app to crash or become unresponsive. This can be done by exploiting a vulnerability in the app's activity launch mechanism.

Steps to exploit an activity for Denial of Service using Drozer:

1. Install Drozer on your computer and connect your Android device to it.

2. Run the command drozer console connect to establish a connection to the device.

3. Use the command run app.package.list -f <target_app_name> to find the package name of the target app.

4. Use the command run app.activity.info -a <target_app_package_name> to list the activities of the target app.

5. Inspect the activities of the target app and look for any that have the attribute "exported" set to "true", indicating that they can be launched from other apps.

6. Create a new android project and add the Drozer agent as a dependency.

7. Use a loop to repeatedly launch the target activity using the command run app.activity.start --component <target_app_package_name> <target_activity_name> The target app will be flooded with requests, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
