How to check insecure deep links using drozer step by step

Deep links are URLs that are used to directly open a specific activity or component within an app, bypassing the app's launcher activity. Insecure deep links can be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or perform other malicious actions within the app.

Steps to check for insecure deep links using drozer:

1. Install drozer on your system and connect your android device to your computer

2. Run the command "drozer console connect" to connect to the device

3. Run the command "run app.activity.info -a <package name>" to list all the activities that are exported by the app.

4. Look for activities that have the intent-filter android.intent.action.VIEW or android.intent.category.BROWSABLE

5. Run the command "run app.activity.start --component <package name> <activity name>" to start the activity directly

6. Observe if the activity can be started with or without authentication

7. Observe if the activity can be started with or without additional privilege

8. Check if the activity contains any sensitive information
